# 42API_TOOLS
The ultimate objective was to make a bot that goes and check for slots every minute or so, unfortunately it didnt work...

## What is it?
It is a set of tools to retrieve data directly through the api. The main part of the project is the OAuth42.py module, containing the OAuth42 class made by me and myself.

## Requierments

```bash
pip install gitpython # for the cursus cloner
```

## Tools
The tools are examples of the usage of the OAuth42 class.
To use the tools, simply launch them one by one with python3.


[x] cursus_cloner.py - clones all your repositories, most likely in a folder called "pedago_world".

[x] guidelines_retriever.py - retrieve all the guidelines (evaluation page) from the projects of a given user.

[ ] find_slots.py - Well... it does find slots, but that's about all... this one is a failure.
