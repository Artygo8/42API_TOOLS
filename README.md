# 42API_TOOLS
The ultimate objective was to make a bot that goes and check for slots every minute or so, unfortunately it didnt work...

## What is it?
It is a set of tools to retrieve data directly through the api. The main part of the project is the OAuth42.py module, containing the OAuth42 class made by me and myself.

## Requierments

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

## Tools
The tools are examples of the usage of the OAuth42 class.
To use the tools, simply launch them one by one with python3.


 - [x] cursus_cloner.py - clones all your repositories, most likely in a folder called "pedago_world".

 - [x] guidelines_retriever.py - retrieve all the guidelines (evaluation page) from the projects of a given user.

 - [x] find_slots.py - Well... Maybe not so bad after all, get notified when someone puts slots (you need your project_id).
